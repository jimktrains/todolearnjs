ToDo: Helping to learn JavaScript and jQuery
--------------------------------------------
This is the start of a project to help
teach JavaScript and jQuery in a manner
that makes sense, builds on itself, and
helps to point out pitfalls such as the
quirks in JavaScript and how to avoid
[HTML Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTML_Injection) and
[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_\(XSS\))
attacks.
